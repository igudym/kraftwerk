Warnings
========

The whole array of commands could do with more warnings. There are 
some especially damaging commands in there. 

Services load / dump
====================

Exclude include services
------------------------

  kraftwerk dump --exclude files

CDN
===

Use s3fslite? It could be written like a files service except files 
get eventually synced to S3.

Deployment
==========

Maybe projects could specify a path to check for HTTP 1.0 200. It 
would serve as a last check at the gate before deployment.

Deploy
======

Rollback. Timestamped releases with symlinks is a popular method.
