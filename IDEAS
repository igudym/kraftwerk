Services load / dump
====================

Remember the project dumps and loads run through all services a 
project defines and aggregate folder paths left behind each service's
dump process.

Where do files end up?
----------------------

By default the script could print the location of a tarball on the 
server - maybe ask "scp to home folder?"

The compiled dump could manifest.

    kraftwerk dump --manifest s3 --node myserver
    kraftwerk dump --node myserver

Exclude include services
------------------------

  kraftwerk dump --exclude files

CDN

Use s3fslite? It could be written like a files service except files 
get eventually synced to S3.
