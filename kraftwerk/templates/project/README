Your project must follow these conventions:

  + The top directory (where this file is stored) is a virtualenv. 
    Kraftwerk refers to this directory as SITE_ROOT.
  + Kraftwerk looks for a subdirectory of the same name. This is a 
    Python package that kraftwerk deploys. You may wish to store code 
    in a different directory, just add a "src" config parameter to 
    your kraftwerk.yaml to overwrite it. 

It is probably a good idea to put PROJECT_ROOT under version control.

kraftwerk has a special `files` service. It makes sure that a 
directory located at os.environ["UPLOADS_PATH"] is writable by the web 
server user.
