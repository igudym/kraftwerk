You can version control however you want. Deployment uses rsync.

Your project must follow these conventions:

  + Top directory name is the SITE_ROOT; a Python virtualenv
  + Underneath SITE_ROOT there should be a code directory with the 
    same name - kraftwerk refers to it as PROJECT_ROOT
  + PROJECT_ROOT must have a wsgi.py that defines the WSGI 
    application callable
  + SITE_ROOT must have a service directory with an executable `run` 
    file that the runit utility uses to daemonize and run the WSGI
    server process - you may define the number of workers, and export
    environment variables here
  + SITE_ROOT and PROJECT_ROOT must have the same name

In short: kraftwerk expects this structure:

 - /{{ project }}/{{ project }}/wsgi.py
 - /{{ project }}/service/run (chmod +x)
