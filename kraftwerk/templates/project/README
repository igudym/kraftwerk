Your project must follow these conventions:

  + Top directory name is the SITE_ROOT; a Python virtualenv
  + Underneath SITE_ROOT there should be a code directory with the 
    same name - kraftwerk refers to it as PROJECT_ROOT
  + SITE_ROOT must have a service directory with an executable `site` 
    file that the runit utility uses to daemonize and run the WSGI
    server process - you may define the number of workers, and export
    environment variables here (uses gunicorn)
  + SITE_ROOT and PROJECT_ROOT must have the same name

In short: kraftwerk expects this structure:

 - /{{ project }}/{{ project }}/wsgi.py
 - /{{ project }}/service/run (chmod +x)

Normally only the PROJECT_ROOT will be rsynced over. If this is a 
virgin deployment defined services will be copied over too. It is 
probably a good idea to put PROJECT_ROOT under VCS and leave other
parts of the site out. 

The service directory contains executable shell scripts. Once 
deployed the server will daemonize them with the runit utility and
do it's best to keep flaky services running and start them again on a
server boot. stdout will be logged for each service.

kraftwerk has a special `files` service. It makes sure that a 
directory located at /{{ project }}/files/ is writable by the web 
server.
